  The value of 'host' attribute of keyspace tag should match exactly what is in
  gora.properties file. Essentially this means that if you are using port number, you should
  use it every where regardless of whether it is the default port or not. 
  At runtime Gora will otherwise try to connect to localhost
  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GORA-269
  
  The value of 'ttl' (time to live) attribute of field tag should most likely always
  be zero unless you want Cassandra to create Tombstones and delete portions of your
  data once this period expires. Any positive value is read and bound to the number 
  of seconds after which the value for that field will disappear.
  
  The value used here for 'gc_grace_seconds' of '0' is ONLY VIABLE FOR SINGLE NODE
  CLUSTER. you should update this value according to your cluster configuration.
