   Chukwa HICC  provides REST interfaces for dashboard rendering.
   The primary resources are:

   <ul>
     <li>Dashboard resource - the configuration of dashboard.</li>
     <li>Widget resource - the configuration of widgets.</li>
   </ul>
   
</p><br/>
<p>
   The resources and the entities that are passed to them are defined
   using JAXB and are represented in either XML or JSON formats
   depending on the ContentType and Accept HTTP headers. The definition
   of the types is given in the 
   <a href="org/apache/hadoop/chukwa/hicc/rest/package-summary.html">JavaDoc</a>.
</p><br/>

   The typical usage are:

   <ul>
     <li>Create a chart</li>
     <li>Create a widget, register chart with widget</li>
     <li>Create a dashboard, register widget with dashboard</li>
