<doc xml:lang="en" title="Chukwa Agent REST API">

<p>
   Chukwa Agent provides REST interfaces that allow management of 
   data stream movement.  The primary resources are:

   <ul>
     <li>Adaptor resource - the registration, querying, and deletion of 
     Chukwa Adaptors.</li>

     <li>Pipeline resource - the configuration of data destination. (TBD)</li>
   </ul>
   
</p><br/>
<p>
   The resources and the entities that are passed to them are defined
   using JAXB and are represented in either XML or JSON formats
   depending on the ContentType and Accept HTTP headers. The definition
   of the types is given in the 
   <a href="org/apache/hadoop/chukwa/datacollection/agent/rest/package-summary.html">JavaDoc</a>.
</p><br/>
<p>
   Typical usage would be to create a new adaptor from a pre-defined 
   one and change the necessary configuration parameters.  Then configure
   parser to process the data stream.
