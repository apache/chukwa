<!--
In addition to family 'name' and 'maxVersions' attributes, 
individual table families can ve defined with several other
attributes such as
  compression="$$$" - the compression option to use in HBase.
  blockCache="$$$"  - an LRU cache that contains three levels of block priority 
                      to allow for scan-resistance and in-memory ColumnFamilies.
  blockSize="$$$"   - The blocksize can be configured for each ColumnFamily in 
                      a table, and this defaults to 64k.
  bloomFilter="$$$" - Bloom Filters can be enabled per-ColumnFamily.
  maxVersions="$$$" - The maximum number of row versions to store is configured 
                      per column family via HColumnDescriptor.
  timeToLive="$$$"  - ColumnFamilies can set a TTL length in seconds, and HBase 
                      will automatically delete rows once the expiration time is 
                      reached.
  inMemory="$$$"    - ColumnFamilies can optionally be defined as in-memory.

You should consult the current Gora gora-hbase documentation
for further information on properties and mapping configurtion.
