Release Notes - Apache  Chukwa - Version ${VERSION}

Overall Status

  This is the fifth public release of Apache Chukwa, a log analysis framework on top of 
Apache Hadoop and Apache HBase.  Apache Chukwa has been tested at scale and used in some 
production settings, and is reasonably robust and well behaved. For instructions on 
setting up Apache Chukwa, see the administration guide and the rest of Apache Chukwa 
documentation.

Important Changes Since Last Release

  * New dashboard design.

  * New Apache Chukwa Parquet file format.

  * New Apache HBase schema for improved low latency read performance.

  * New Solr log indexing support.

  * There have been a number of bug fixes and code cleanups since the last release; 
    check the changelog and JIRA for details.

Requirements

  Apache Chukwa relies on Java 1.6, and requires maven 3.0.3 to build.
The back-end processing requires Apache Hadoop ${hadoopVersion}, 
Apache HBase ${hbaseVersion}+, and Apache Solr ${solrVersion}+.

Known Limitations

  * There is currently no HDFS file compaction and retention support.
