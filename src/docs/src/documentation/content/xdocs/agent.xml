    <title>Chukwa Agent Setup Guide</title>
  </header>
  <body>

<section>
<title>Overview</title>
<p>In a normal Chukwa installation, an <em>Agent</em> process runs on every 
machine being monitored. This process is responsible for all the data collection
on that host.  Data collection might mean periodically running a Unix command,
or tailing a file, or listening for incoming UDP packets.</p>

<p>Each particular data source corresponds to a so-called <em>Adaptor</em>. 
Adaptors are dynamically loadable modules that run inside the Agent process. 
There is generally one Adaptor for each data source: for each file being watched 
or for each Unix command being executed. Each adaptor has a unique name. If you 
do not specify a name, one will be autogenerated by hashing the Adaptor type and
parameters.</p>

<p>There are a number of Adaptors built into Chukwa, and you can also develop
your own. Chukwa will use them if you add them to the Chukwa library search path
 (e.g., by putting them in a jarfile in <code>$CHUKWA_HOME/lib</code>.)</p>
</section>



<section>
<title>Agent Control</title>

<p>Once an Agent process is running, there are a number of commands that you can
 use to inspect and control it.  By default, Agents listen for incoming commands
  on port 9093. Commands are case-insensitive</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Command</td><td>Purpose</td><td>Options</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>add</code>   </td><td> Start an adaptor.</td>  <td>See below</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>close</code> </td><td> Close socket connection to agent.</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>help</code>  </td><td> Display a list of available commands</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>list</code>  </td><td> List currently running adaptors</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>reloadcollectors</code>  </td><td> Re-read list of collectors</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>stop</code>  </td><td> Stop adaptor, abruptly</td><td>Adaptor name</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>shutdown</code>  </td><td> Stop adaptor, gracefully</td><td>Adaptor name</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>stopagent</code>  </td><td> Stop agent process</td><td>None</td></tr>
</table>


<p>The add command is by far the most complex; it takes several mandatory and 
optional parameters. The general form is as follows:</p>
<source>
add [name =] &#60;adaptor_class_name&#62; &#60;datatype&#62; &#60;adaptor 
specific params&#62; &#60;initial offset&#62;. 
</source>

<p>
There are four mandatory fields: The word <code>add</code>, the class name for 
the Adaptor, the datatype of the Adaptor's output, and the sequence number for 
the first byte.  There are two optional fields; the adaptor instance name, and 
the adaptor parameters.
</p>

<p>The adaptor name, if specified, should go after the add command, and be 
followed with an equals sign. It should be a string of printable characters, 
without whitespace or '='.  
</p>

<p>Adaptor parameters aren't required by the add command, but adaptor 
implementations may have both mandatory and optional parameters. See below.</p>
</section>

<section>
<title>Command-line options</title>
<p>Normally, agents are configured via the file <code>conf/chukwa-agent-conf.xml.</code>
However, there are a few command-line options that are sometimes useful in
troubleshooting. If you specify "local" as an option, then the agent will print
chunks to standard out, rather than to a collector. If you specify a URI, then
that will be used as collector, overriding the collectors specified in
<code>conf/collectors</code>.  These options are intended for testing and debugging,
not for production use.</p>

<section> 
<title>Adaptors</title>
<p>This section lists the standard adaptors, and the arguments they take.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>FileAdaptor</strong>: Pushes a whole file, as one Chunk, then exits.
 Takes one mandatory parameter; the file to push.

<source>add FileTailer FooData /tmp/foo 0</source>
This pushes file <code>/tmp/foo</code> as one chunk, with datatype <code>FooData</code>.
</li>
<li><strong>filetailer.FileTailingAdaptor</strong>
 Repeatedly tails a file, treating the file as a sequence of bytes, ignoring the
  content. Chunk boundaries are arbitrary. This is useful for streaming binary 
  data. Takes one mandatory parameter; a path to the file to tail.
<source>add filetailer.FileTailingAdaptor BarData /foo/bar 0</source>
This pushes <code>/foo/bar</code> in a sequence of Chunks of type <code>BarData</code>

</li>
<li><strong>filetailer.CharFileTailingAdaptorUTF8</strong>
The same, except that chunks are guaranteed to end only at carriage returns.
 This is useful for most ASCII log file formats.
</li>

<li><strong>filetailer.CharFileTailingAdaptorUTF8NewLineEscaped</strong>
 The same, except that chunks are guaranteed to end only at non-escaped carriage
  returns. This is useful for pushing Chukwa-formatted log files, where exception
   stack traces stay in a single chunk.
</li>

<li><strong>DirTailingAdaptor</strong> Takes a directory path and a second
 adaptor name as mandatory parameters; repeatedly scans that directory and all
 subdirectories, and starts the indicated adaptor running on each file. Since
 the DirTailingAdaptor does not, itself, emit data, the datatype parameter is 
 applied to the newly-spawned adaptors.  Note  that if you try this on a large 
 directory, it is possible to exceed your system's limit on open files.

<source>add DirTailingAdaptor logs /var/log/ filetailer.CharFileTailingAdaptorUTF8 0</source>

</li>
<li><strong>ExecAdaptor</strong> Takes a frequency (in miliseconds) as optional 
parameter, and then program name as mandatory parameter. Runs that program 
repeatedly at a rate specified by frequency.

<source>add ExecAdaptor Df 60000 /bin/df -x nfs -x none 0</source>
 This adaptor will run <code>df</code> every minute, labelling output as Df.
</li>

<li><strong>edu.berkeley.chukwa_xtrace.XtrAdaptor</strong> (available in contrib)
 Takes an <a href="http://www.x-trace.net/wiki/doku.php">Xtrace</a> ReportSource
 classname [without package] as mandatory argument, and no optional parameters.
 Listens for incoming reports in the same way as that ReportSource would.

<source>add edu.berkeley.chukwa_xtrace.XtrAdaptor Xtrace UdpReportSource 0</source>
 This adaptor will create and start a <code>UdpReportSource</code>, labeling its
  output datatype as Xtrace.
</li>
</ul>
